            title:"Difference between SQL and NoSQL",
            details: "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems. Here are the main differences between them: Data Model: SQL: SQL databases are based on a relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Each table has a predefined schema, specifying the structure and relationships between tables. NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. They offer flexible schema design, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data. Schema: SQL: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning that the structure of the data must be defined before data insertion. Any changes to the schema require altering the table structure, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. NoSQL: NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema, allowing for schema-less data storage. Data can be inserted without a predefined structure, and each document or entry can have its own unique schema. Scalability: SQL: SQL databases traditionally scale vertically, meaning that they are designed to run on a single server with increased resources (CPU, RAM, etc.). Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) can be challenging and often requires complex replication and partitioning techniques. NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers seamlessly. They can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by adding more servers to the cluster. Transactions and ACID Compliance: SQL: SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that database transactions are reliably processed. They provide strong consistency and strict transactional integrity. NoSQL: NoSQL databases often sacrifice ACID properties for performance and scalability. They provide eventual consistency, where data changes are propagated asynchronously and may take some time to be fully consistent across all replicas. Query Language: SQL: SQL databases use the SQL query language for data retrieval and manipulation. SQL offers a standardized and powerful syntax for complex queries, joins, aggregations, and data transformations. NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to their data models. For example, key-value stores may have simple key-based retrieval, while document databases may use JSON-based queries. Use Cases: SQL: SQL databases are well-suited for structured data with complex relationships, such as financial transactions, e-commerce systems, and business applications that require strong data consistency. NoSQL: NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, big data analytics, content management systems, real-time applications, and situations where high scalability and agility are paramount. It's important to note that the distinction between SQL and NoSQL is not absolute, and there are hybrid databases and new database technologies emerging that combine features from both paradigms. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application or system you are building."

            title:"What is JWT, and how does it work?",
            details:"JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between two parties as a compact and self-contained JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs. A JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature, which are concatenated and encoded using Base64 URL encoding to form a compact string. Header: The header contains information about the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm used. It is typically represented as a JSON object and base64 encoded. Payload: The payload, also known as the claims or the body, contains the actual data or claims about the user or entity. Claims can include information like the user's ID, roles, permissions, expiration time, etc. Like the header, the payload is also represented as a JSON object and base64 encoded. Signature: The signature is created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key known only to the server. It is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the token. The server signs the token with the secret key, and clients can verify the signature using the same key. The signature is appended to the token as the third part. Here's a step-by-step overview of how JWT works: Authentication: The user provides their credentials (username/password) to the server for authentication. Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT by creating the header, payload, and signature. Token Issuance: The server sends the JWT back to the client as a response. Token Storage: The client stores the JWT, commonly in local storage or as a cookie. Token Usage: For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the request header or as a parameter. Token Verification: The server receives the JWT from the client and verifies its authenticity by checking the signature using the secret key. Payload Access: If the signature is valid, the server decodes the JWT to access the claims in the payload. This allows the server to identify the user, perform authorization checks, and extract relevant information. Authorization: Based on the information in the payload, the server grants or denies access to the requested resources or operations. Expiration: JWTs often have an expiration time (or expiry) specified in the payload. After this time, the token is considered invalid, and the client needs to obtain a new token by repeating the authentication process. JWTs are self-contained, which means that the server can validate the token without requiring a centralized session store or database lookup. This makes JWTs suitable for stateless authentication systems and distributed environments. However, it's crucial to protect the secrecy of the secret key used for signing JWTs to prevent token tampering or unauthorized access."

            title:"What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?",
            details:"JavaScript and Node.js are closely related but serve different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences: JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It was originally created to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. JavaScript is executed within the browser and can manipulate the HTML DOM, handle events, perform client-side validations, and make asynchronous requests. It has a wide range of applications, including building interactive web applications, browser extensions, and mobile app development using frameworks like React Native or Ionic. JavaScript code runs in a browser environment and has access to browser-specific APIs. Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 engine that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side. It provides an environment for running JavaScript outside the browser, enabling server-side scripting. Node.js is event-driven and uses a non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model, which makes it efficient for handling concurrent requests and building scalable applications. It comes with a set of built-in modules, such as HTTP, file system, and networking, allowing developers to create web servers, handle file operations, and build network applications. Node.js has a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager) that provides access to a vast ecosystem of reusable JavaScript libraries and frameworks. It is widely used for building server-side applications, real-time web applications, APIs, microservices, and command-line tools. In summary, JavaScript is a programming language primarily used in web browsers to add interactivity to web pages, while Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side, enabling the development of server-side applications and leveraging JavaScript's capabilities beyond the browser."

            title:"How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?",
            details:"Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle multiple requests at the same time efficiently. Here's an overview of how Node.js achieves this: Single-Threaded Event Loop: Node.js runs on a single thread but uses an event loop to handle multiple requests concurrently. The event loop continuously listens for events and executes callbacks when events occur. It ensures that the execution of code is non-blocking, allowing Node.js to handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for each request to complete before moving to the next one. Asynchronous I/O: Node.js utilizes asynchronous I/O operations for file I/O, network requests, and other I/O tasks. When a request involves I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request, Node.js initiates the operation and registers a callback function. While waiting for the I/O operation to complete, Node.js proceeds to handle other requests, maximizing the utilization of the single thread. Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js leverages an event-driven architecture, where events are emitted when certain actions occur, such as the completion of an I/O operation or the arrival of a new request. Event emitters send events to the event loop, which then triggers the appropriate callback functions. Developers can register event listeners or callbacks to handle specific events, such as processing the response of an HTTP request or handling a database query result. Non-Blocking Design: Node.js emphasizes non-blocking design patterns to avoid blocking the execution of code. Instead of waiting for a resource-intensive operation to complete, Node.js delegates the operation to underlying system libraries or other threads, allowing the main thread to continue processing other requests. When the operation completes, the corresponding callback is executed, and the result is handled. By combining these mechanisms, Node.js can handle multiple requests concurrently with a single thread. This approach is particularly useful for I/O-bound applications, such as web servers, where a significant portion of the time is spent waiting for I/O operations to complete. The non-blocking nature of Node.js enables efficient utilization of system resources and provides high scalability and responsiveness."
